# GNURootLibrary

This repository provides an Android Library Project for people wanting to make GNURoot applications (you can create your own if you like).  

It is used by GNURoot Octave and GNURoot Debian (more to come).  

This can be built using the Android Studio 1.4 Beta 3 (probably newer versions too), using the experimental gradle plugin.
